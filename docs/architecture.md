# Architecture

A Go library + binary that fronts three kinds of upstream services
under a single typed GraphQL surface:

- **gRPC services** described by `.proto`, registered via
  `AddProto[Descriptor]` or the gRPC control plane.
- **OpenAPI 3.x services** described by a JSON/YAML spec, registered
  via `AddOpenAPI[Bytes]` or the same control plane (proto field
  `ServiceBinding.openapi_spec`).
- **Existing GraphQL services** stitched in via `AddGraphQL`
  (boot-time introspection + namespace-prefixed type mirror).

Multi-gateway clustering via embedded NATS; subscriptions via NATS
pub/sub with HMAC channel auth.

## Architecture in five lines

1. Services register at runtime via control plane gRPC (proto **or**
   OpenAPI bindings) or boot-time via `AddProto` / `AddOpenAPI` /
   `AddGraphQL`.
2. Every registration occupies one *slot* per `(namespace, version)`
   in `g.slots`, kind-tagged (proto / openapi / graphql). The slot
   owns the per-kind dispatch handle (`slot.proto` is a `pool` with
   replicas, sems, FileDescriptor; `slot.openapi` is an
   `openAPISource`; `slot.graphql` is a `graphQLSource`) and the
   request-ready IR (`slot.ir`) baked at registration time. Multi-
   replica adds against the slot; cross-kind collision rejects;
   `unstable` swaps; `vN` is locked. `registerSlotLocked` is the
   single tier-policy decision site.
3. The schema is rebuilt on every slot create/destroy. Schema
   rebuild is one iteration over `g.slots` reading `slot.ir`
   (already post-transform, post-internal-filter, schema-IDs
   populated); the per-kind ingest happens once at registration
   only. SDL + introspection + transformed FDS exposed at
   `/schema/{graphql,proto,openapi}`.
4. Multi-gateway clusters share the registry via JetStream KV;
   reconcilers on every node sync local slot state from a KV
   watch (proto, OpenAPI, and GraphQL bindings ride in the same
   value shape; `slot.kind` picks the install / remove path).
5. Server-streaming RPCs become GraphQL subscription fields backed
   by NATS pub/sub. HMAC verify on subscribe; sign-side gate is the
   admin/boot token plus optional `WithSignerSecret` (gRPC peer calls
   only — in-process bypasses). The gateway also publishes its own
   service-change events on `admin_events_watchServices`.

for the library and `github.com/iodesystems/gwag/gw/proto/...`
for the generated bindings.

## Design notes

- **Reflection-based default path.** `.proto` and OpenAPI specs
  parse at boot via `bufbuild/protocompile` / `kin-openapi`; gRPC
  calls go out via `dynamicpb`; HTTP calls assemble from the spec.
  Any registered service works without a build step. Codegen and
  plugin paths layer on as opt-in upgrades for extra throughput.
- **Path-based identity.** Namespaces default to filename stems;
  collisions across registered files are an error, not silent
  overwrite.
- **Two registries.** Public schema view vs internal callable
  registry. Internal-only services live in the callable registry but
  not the external schema; hooks (auth resolver, etc.) call them.
- **Caching is library-side.** A naive auth resolver gets called once
  per field per request; the library memoises per-(request, type) so
  users don't reinvent it.
- **`Reject(code, msg)` for short-circuits.** Plain errors are mapped
  to opaque internal errors; typed rejections become the right GraphQL
  error code (and gRPC status when bridged outbound).
- **Auto-internal `_*` namespaces.** Any namespace starting with `_`
  is hidden from the public schema. `_events_auth`, `_admin_auth`,
  `_admin_events`, etc. — operators don't have to remember a flag.
- **Dogfood the OpenAPI path.** The gateway's own admin operations
  are defined via huma → OpenAPI → self-ingested → surfaced as
  `admin_*` GraphQL fields. Same path any external service takes.

## HTTP routing surface

The example gateway splits routes by prefix: `/api/*` is the
gateway, everything else is the embedded UI bundle. Unmatched
`/api/*` returns JSON 404 (so a typo doesn't render the SPA);
non-API requests fall back to the SPA's `index.html` for client-
side routing.

| Path | Auth | What |
|---|---|---|
| `/api/graphql` (queries, subscriptions) | public | GraphQL + WebSocket upgrade for subscriptions |
| `/api/graphql` (mutations) | bearer (transitive) | `admin_*` dispatch through `/api/admin/*` — operator sends `Authorization: Bearer <token>` to `/api/graphql`; gateway forwards on outbound dispatch |
| `/api/schema`, `/api/schema/graphql` | public | SDL (or `?format=json` for introspection) |
| `/api/schema/proto?service=...` | public | FileDescriptorSet (transformed) |
| `/api/schema/openapi?service=...` | public | Re-emit ingested OpenAPI specs |
| `/api/admin/*` reads (GET) | public | huma reads (peers, services list) |
| `/api/admin/*` writes | bearer | huma mutations (forget, sign) |
| `/api/health` | public | JSON status; 503 when `Drain()` is in flight |
| `/api/metrics` | public (or behind reverse-proxy auth) | Prometheus scrape |
| `/api/...` (unmatched) | n/a | JSON 404 |
| `/`, `/{anything}` | public | Embedded SPA bundle from `ui/dist/`; `index.html` SPA fallback for unknown paths |

The bearer is the gateway's boot token (logged at startup, persisted
to `<adminDataDir>/admin-token` if `WithAdminDataDir(...)` is set).
The pluggable AdminAuthorizer delegate (registered under
`_admin_auth/v1`) is consulted first; the boot token is the
always-works emergency hatch underneath. Outbound auth to upstream
services is a separate concern: `WithOpenAPIClient` /
`OpenAPIClient(c)` / `ForwardHeaders` — see
[`admin-auth.md`](./admin-auth.md).

The `/api/*` split is an example wiring choice, not a library
constraint. `gateway.UIHandler(fs.FS)` and the per-handler primitives
(`gw.Handler()`, `gw.SchemaHandler()`, `gw.AdminMiddleware(...)`) let
operators arrange the routes however they like. The `gw/cmd/gwag` CLI
mounts GraphQL at `/` directly when no UI is in play.
